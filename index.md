## Threat Models

**Threat modeling** is the assessment of your risk and the adversary, such as their capability and your weakess link. Knowing and planning your threat models well can help you to secure your operation in the least amount of risks. There can be multiple threat models depending on the levels and numbers of adversary you would face. Where securing one threat model will be risked of exposing you from another threat model with higher risks. Example for lower level threat model, of using multiple profiles and identities would prevent people doxxing you, however on the higher threat model it does not stop state actor from tracking you.

The basics and necessity of planning your threat models is to be clear about the goals you want to protect, and what to prevent. Having a check list of all the stuff you want to prioritize and protect, such as your data/identity/profile/source/etc. Have a check list of all the questions and answers. Examples:

* *Who and what do you want to protect?* **Your identity/data/source that could compromise you and other people.**
* *Who and what do you want to protect from?* **Fascists, state actors and identity thieves.**
* *How are you going to protect them?* **Multiple identities, separate operation/private profiles, encrypt your communication and devices.**
* *What are the consequence if you fail?* **Harassment, threats to yourselves/friends/family, get fired from work, risk of arrest.**
* *What are the risks you going through to protect?* **Budget of securing your devices, cost of time, accessibility vs. security.**

## Metadata

Metadata is the information trails of everything you do and act in the modern world, as of who/what/where/when/why/how they came about, it does not distinguish whether it was physical or digital actions. An example of metadata would be your snail mail in the post office. The stamp, location, identity and the envelope you used for your mail would be the metadata.
